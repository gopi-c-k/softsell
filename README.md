## 🎨 Design Choices

| Element        | Design Rationale |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Color Palette** | Soft Sky Blue & Teal accents with White/Dark Gray base to ensure readability and freshness |
| **Typography** | Inter (sans-serif), modern and clean with bold headings and lighter body text |
| **Layout** | Grid-based sectioning with strong visual hierarchy, spacing, and consistent margins |
| **Icons** | Used `react-icons` to enhance visual understanding and interactivity |
| **Form Styling** | Clean, rounded inputs with focus states and smooth shadows for depth |
| **Dark Mode** | Improves accessibility and reduces eye strain in low-light environments |

I dedicated **4–5 hours** to:
- Designing a visually appealing UI from scratch
- Implementing a complete layout overhaul
- Adding meaningful interactions and accessibility
- Tuning responsiveness for desktop and mobile
- Writing clean, readable React code with Tailwind CSS
